# Railway Deployment Configuration Summary

This document summarizes all the changes made to prepare the Neural Network Angular Demo for Railway deployment.

## Project Structure Solution

**Issue**: Railway was failing to build because it couldn't find `package.json` in the root directory. The Angular application is located in the `neural-angular-demo/` subdirectory.

**Solution**: Created a root-level `package.json` that delegates build and start commands to the subdirectory, allowing Railway to detect and build the project correctly.

## Files Added

### 1. Root-Level Railway Configuration

- **`package.json`** - Root package.json with delegation scripts
- **`railway.json`** - Railway-specific deployment configuration
- **`Procfile`** - Process configuration for Railway
- **`Dockerfile`** - Docker configuration (alternative deployment method)

### 2. Server Configuration (in neural-angular-demo/ subdirectory)

- **`neural-angular-demo/server.js`** - Express server to serve the built Angular application
  - Serves static files from `dist/neural-angular-demo`
  - Handles Angular routing (SPA fallback)
  - Includes health check endpoint at `/health`

### 3. Environment Configuration (in neural-angular-demo/src/environments/)

- **`neural-angular-demo/src/environments/environment.ts`** - Development environment configuration
- **`neural-angular-demo/src/environments/environment.prod.ts`** - Production environment configuration

### 4. Documentation

- **`RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT.md`** - Comprehensive deployment guide for Railway
- **`neural-angular-demo/test-production.sh`** - Script to test production build locally

## Files Modified

### 1. Package Configuration

- **`neural-angular-demo/package.json`**
  - Added Express dependency for serving the app
  - Moved Angular CLI and compiler to dependencies (needed for Railway build)
  - Added production build and start scripts
  - Added `heroku-postbuild` script for compatibility

### 2. Angular Configuration

- **`angular.json`**
  - Added file replacement configuration for environment files
  - Production build now uses `environment.prod.ts`

### 3. Services Updated

- **`src/app/services/neural-network.service.ts`**

  - Now uses environment configuration for API URL
  - Automatically switches between development and production endpoints

- **`src/app/services/websocket/training-websocket.service.ts`**
  - Now uses environment configuration for WebSocket URL
  - Automatically switches between development and production endpoints

### 4. Documentation

- **`README.md`** - Added Railway deployment section and quick deploy instructions

## Environment Configuration

### Development

- API URL: `http://localhost:8000/api`
- WebSocket URL: `http://localhost:8000`
- Used when running `ng serve`

### Production

- API URL: `https://neural-network-intro-production.up.railway.app/api`
- WebSocket URL: `https://neural-network-intro-production.up.railway.app`
- Used when building with `ng build --configuration production`

## Deployment Process

The Railway deployment follows this process:

1. **Source**: Code is pulled from GitHub repository
2. **Build**:
   - `npm ci` - Install dependencies
   - `npm run build:prod` - Build Angular app for production
3. **Start**:
   - `npm run start:prod` - Start Express server on Railway's assigned port
4. **Health Check**:
   - Railway monitors `/health` endpoint
   - Returns JSON with service status

## Key Features

### 1. Automatic Environment Switching

- Development and production configurations are automatically applied
- No manual configuration needed when deploying

### 2. Express Server

- Serves the built Angular application
- Handles client-side routing for SPA
- Provides health check endpoint for Railway monitoring

### 3. Production Optimizations

- Angular production build with optimizations
- File replacement for environment-specific configurations
- Proper dependency management for deployment

### 4. Railway Integration

- Health check endpoint for monitoring
- Proper port configuration using `process.env.PORT`
- Restart policy configuration
- Build and deployment commands specified

## Testing

To test the production build locally:

```bash
# Run the test script
npm run test:prod

# Or manually:
npm run build:prod
npm run start:prod
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000` (or the PORT environment variable).

## Next Steps

1. **Push to GitHub**: Commit all changes and push to your repository
2. **Deploy to Railway**: Connect your GitHub repository to Railway
3. **Monitor**: Check Railway logs to ensure successful deployment
4. **Test**: Verify the deployed application works correctly

The application is now fully configured for Railway deployment with proper environment management and production optimizations.
