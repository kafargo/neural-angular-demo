# ROUTER IMPLEMENTATION FIX

## Problem
Railway health checks were failing because the Angular app was using `*ngIf` for navigation instead of Angular's router with `<router-outlet>`. This prevented proper routing and health check handling.

## Solution
Converted the app from conditional rendering (`*ngIf`) to Angular's router with `<router-outlet>`:

### 1. Updated app.routes.ts
- Added proper route definitions for all components
- Added wildcard route for 404 handling
- Added default redirect to '/learn'

### 2. Updated app.component.html
- Replaced all `*ngIf` directives with `<router-outlet></router-outlet>`
- Simplified template to use router for navigation

### 3. Updated app.component.ts
- Added Router and RouterOutlet imports
- Created AppStateService for shared state management
- Updated navigation methods to use router.navigate()

### 4. Created AppStateService
- Centralized state management using BehaviorSubjects
- Shared state across all components when using router
- Observables for reactive updates

### 5. Updated all components
- Removed @Input/@Output dependencies
- Added OnInit to load state from AppStateService
- Updated navigation to use router instead of events

### 6. Fixed server.js
- Health endpoint registered before catch-all route
- Proper Express static file serving
- Bind to 0.0.0.0 and use process.env.PORT

## Key Changes
- `app.component.html`: Now uses `<router-outlet></router-outlet>`
- `app.routes.ts`: Proper Angular routes defined
- `app-state.service.ts`: New service for shared state
- All components updated to work with router-based navigation
- Express server properly configured for Angular routing

This matches the working sample repository pattern where Angular router handles client-side routing while Express handles the /health endpoint and serves the Angular app.
