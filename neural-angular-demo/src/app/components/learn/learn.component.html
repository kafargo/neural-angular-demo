        <h3>What is Machine Learning?</h3>
        <p>
          Machine learning is a method of teaching computers to learn patterns
          from data without being explicitly programmed for every scenario.
          Neural networks are inspired by how biological neurons work in the
          brain.

        <h3>MNIST Dataset</h3>
        <p>
          We'll use the famous MNIST dataset of handwritten digits (0-9). Each
          image is 28x28 pixels, giving us 784 input features that our network
          will learn to classify into 10 categories.

        <h3>How Neural Networks Learn</h3>
        <p>
          Networks learn by adjusting weights between neurons based on training
          examples. Through many iterations, they discover patterns that help
          them recognize similar images they haven't seen before.

      <div class="learn-card">
        <h3>Training Process</h3>
        <p>
          Training involves showing the network thousands of labeled examples,
          calculating errors in predictions, and adjusting internal parameters
          to minimize those errors over time through a process called
          backpropagation.
        </p>

      <div class="learn-card">
        <h3>Network Architecture</h3>
        <p>
          Our network will have an input layer (784 neurons for 28x28 pixel
          images), hidden layers for processing, and an output layer (10 neurons
          for digits 0-9).
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="learn-card">
        <h3>Making Predictions</h3>
        <p>
          Once trained, the network can classify new handwritten digits by
          processing pixel values through its learned weights and producing
          confidence scores for each possible digit (0-9).
